"""Run both matchers on the same costs, every N steps, and record how different they are.

The CUDA matching study has two kinds of evidence that the device solver is a safe substitute
for the host one, and a gap between them.

At the bottom there is :mod:`bench_device_matcher`: on one dumped step's real cost tensors, does
the device solver reach the same *total cost* as scipy's float64 optimum? That is a single
scalar on a single step, and it says nothing about *which* pairing was chosen. At the top there
is the Phase-4 A/B: two full trainings compared on val loss, jet-E IQR and efficiency/purity.
That is what anyone actually cares about, but it is a terminal measurement -- it sits downstream
of ~10^5 optimiser steps, so any difference is entangled with SGD nondeterminism, data order and
seed noise. Overlapping IQR curves are evidence of neutrality, but weak evidence: they can hide
a real solver difference under training noise, and they can equally manufacture one that has
nothing to do with the matcher.

This callback is the missing middle layer. Given *identical* cost matrices, how often do the two
solvers return the same assignment, and when they do not, how much worse is the one the GPU
picked? It measures that inline, on the live model, so the answer comes as a function of
training step rather than from a single frozen snapshot -- which is the one question a replay
of a dumped cost tensor cannot answer: does agreement drift as the model sharpens and its costs
become less degenerate?

Three layers of metric, in increasing order of how much they mean and how much they cost:

1. **Optimality gap.** The matcher minimises total assignment cost, so "quality" is
   ``cost(device permutation) - cost(host optimum)``, per problem, evaluated in float64 on the
   same host cost array for both so the comparison is fair. This is a *solver-correctness*
   check and nothing more. The cost matrix is detached before it reaches the matcher
   (``MaskFormer._compute_decoder_costs``, and ``Task.cost`` again inside it), and its only
   consumer is the assignment problem, so no gradient ever flows through a cost. A zero gap
   says the device solver found an optimal assignment, which makes any disagreement with the
   host a disagreement between *equally optimal* assignments rather than a degradation of the
   matching objective. It does not say the two runs train the same -- that is layer 2's job.
   For the exact ``jv`` solver this is a null check and is expected to be identically zero; for
   the epsilon-optimal auction it is bounded by ``num_valid_targets * eps``.

2. **Assignment agreement / IoU.** This is the layer that bears on training, because the
   permutation is the *only* channel through which the matcher reaches the loss: it selects
   which query's outputs are scored against which target, and everything downstream follows
   from that. An identical permutation gives an identical loss and an identical gradient; a
   different one changes the gradient even when the two assignments cost exactly the same.
   Equal cost does not imply equal permutation, and it does not imply equal loss either --
   the cost is a deliberate *proxy* for the loss rather than the loss (the CLIC v6 config
   scores matching with ``mask_dice`` alone, while the loss it trains on is
   ``mask_bce_v2 * 5 + mask_dice_v2``). Both solvers return a set of (query slot, target)
   pairs; the intersection-over-union of those two sets is ``agree / (2n - agree)`` where
   ``agree`` is the number of shared pairs and ``n`` the number of valid targets. Real
   mask-BCE costs are highly degenerate -- many near-equal entries, ties within fp32 -- so two
   *exact* solvers routinely disagree on the permutation while agreeing exactly on the total,
   which layer 1 cannot see. ``tie_gap`` records how degenerate the swaps are: for each
   disagreeing target, the cost difference between the entry the device solver took and the one
   the host solver took. If those are ~0 the disagreement is a coin flip between equals -- by
   the matcher's criterion. Whether the model cares is layer 3.

3. **Mask IoU of the disagreements.** Layer 2 establishes that the gradient differs; it does
   not say whether the difference matters. So for the pairs where the two solvers disagree, compare
   the mask IoU of the *assigned prediction against its truth particle* under each assignment.
   If those two distributions coincide, the two matchings are physically interchangeable even
   though the permutations differ -- which is a far stronger statement than overlapping jet-E
   IQR curves, and it is made at the level of the object the matcher actually pairs up. An
   equal-sized sample of agreeing pairs is scored alongside as a control, to give the numbers a
   scale: it is the typical mask IoU of a matched pair in this model at this step.

**The measurement cannot alter the training it rides on.** The production ``Matcher.forward``
call is left completely untouched and still produces the permutation the loss uses; the shadow
solve happens beside it, on the same inputs, and its result is thrown away. The device path is
re-solved rather than reused for exactly this reason. Nothing here touches a torch RNG, and the
matcher's own ``step`` and ``device_fallbacks`` counters are restored afterwards, so a run with
this callback on is still a valid arm of a physics A/B.

Cost: on shadow steps only, one extra host solve (threaded, the same ``match_parallel`` the host
arm uses), one extra device solve, and a few thousand mask IoUs. At ``interval: 100`` on the
CLIC B200 geometry that is well under 1% of wall time.

        reference_solver: Host solver taken as the optimum, from ``matcher.SOLVERS``. ``scipy``
            by default: it is the reference the rest of the study scores against, and unlike
            ``lap1015_late`` it has no GIL caveat when threaded.
        n_jobs: Threads for the reference host solve. Only affects the shadow's own cost.
        device_solver: Device solver to score, or ``None`` to use whatever the matcher in the
