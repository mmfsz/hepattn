# Running CLIC on HiPerGator (HPG)

HPG-specific instructions for training and evaluating the CLIC particle-flow model on
UF's HiPerGator cluster. For the model overview, evaluation flags, and data-format
details see [`README.md`](./README.md).

## Prerequisites

- **GPU partitions:**
  - `hpg-b200` — B200 192 GB (up to 4/node)
  - `hpg-turin` — L4 24 GB (up to 3/node)
- **Container + env:** the submit scripts run inside the pixi Apptainer image at the
  repo root (`pixi.sif`) via `apptainer run --nv ... pixi run -e clic ...`, so the `clic`
  pixi environment must be installed in the checkout you submit from. You do not need to
  enter the container by hand to submit.
- **CUDA module:** `module load cuda/12.8.1` (matches the container build; already in
  the submit scripts).
- **Data:** the CLIC ROOT files must be readable from the compute nodes.
  [`configs/hpg.yaml`](./configs/hpg.yaml) points at the group's copy on `/blue`:

  ```
  /blue/avery/m.mazza/projects/fastml/hepattn/data/clic/
  ├── train_clic_fix.root          # 12 GB
  ├── val_clic_fix.root            # 309 MB
  └── test_clic_common_infer.root  # 250 MB
  ```

  The scripts layer that overlay after your config, so `base.yaml` keeps the authors'
  paths and no model config needs editing to run here. If the data moves, change the
  overlay only.

## Submitting a training

Everything is submitted **from the experiment directory**, and the scripts `cd` back to
it on the compute node:

```shell
cd /blue/avery/m.mazza/projects/fastml/hepattn-paper/src/hepattn/experiments/clic
mkdir -p slurm_logs        # sbatch refuses to start if the --output directory is missing
```

One script per kind of job. The model config only defines the model; each script sets the
hardware-dependent settings (device count, batch size per GPU, matcher) on the `main.py`
command line and layers `configs/hpg.yaml` for the data paths, so any config in `configs/`
runs on either machine unchanged.

| Script | Partition | GPUs | `--mem` | Sets | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `submit_training_b200.sh` | `hpg-b200` | 1 B200 | 60G | batch 2048, `configs/matcher_jv.yaml` | fastest way to train |
| `submit_training_l4.sh` | `hpg-turin` | 3 L4 | 150G | batch 170/GPU x 2 accumulation (the paper's global 1020), `configs/matcher_lap1015.yaml` | the paper's geometry |
| `submit_eval_l4.sh` | `hpg-turin` | 1 L4 | 50G | inference mode via `configs/eval.yaml` | evaluate a checkpoint, minutes |
| `submit_validate_run.sh` | `hpg-turin` | 1 L4 | 50G | | re-score a checkpoint on the validation set |

All take the config as their first argument, and anything after it passes straight through
to `main.py`:

```shell
sbatch submit_training_b200.sh configs/base_small.yaml --name my_run
sbatch submit_training_l4.sh configs/base_small.yaml --name my_run
sbatch --export=ALL,RUN_DIR=logs/<run_folder>,CKPT_NAME=<ckpt_file> submit_eval_l4.sh
```

The B200 script needs the GPU matcher's extension built once with
`setup/build_torch_linear_assignment.sh`; it checks for it before training starts. The L4
script needs the GIL-releasing `lap1015` build (`python -c "import lap1015; print(lap1015.releases_gil)"`).

Add `--mail-type=END,FAIL --mail-user=<you>` to the `sbatch` line for e-mail notifications.

### Preflight first, and chain the full run behind it

Before committing a multi-hour allocation, run the same launch path for a few hundred steps
and chain the full run behind it, so it starts only if the preflight passes:

```shell
pf=$(sbatch --parsable --time=00:30:00 --job-name=pf submit_training_b200.sh configs/base_small.yaml \
       --name pf_my_run --trainer.max_steps=300)
sbatch --dependency=afterok:$pf submit_training_b200.sh configs/base_small.yaml --name my_run
```

Check the preflight's SLURM log for the parameter count in `ModelSummary`; a parameter count
alone instantiates every layer but never runs a forward pass, so only a preflight can see a
shape error inside an attention kernel.

### Key rule: devices must match the allocation

`--ntasks-per-node` (SBATCH) must equal `--trainer.devices`, and `--nodes` must equal
`--trainer.num_nodes`. Each script sets both consistently; if you change the GPU count,
change both. Global batch = `num_nodes x devices x data.batch_size x accumulate_grad_batches`.
The learning rate is not batch-scaled, so keep the global batch at the paper's 1020 unless
you mean to change it.

### What the launcher does

Multi-GPU scripts start one task per GPU through [`run_task.sh`](./run_task.sh), which gives
each rank a private Triton/Inductor compile cache on node-local disk before starting the
container. Without it, the ranks race on the shared `$HOME/.triton` cache when the `Compile`
callback compiles the model, one dies with `Text file busy`, and the job hangs on NCCL.

`COMET_MODE=offline` is exported because the compute nodes have no internet and no
`COMET_API_KEY`. The Comet archive lands in the run folder; the CLI also attaches a
`CSVLogger`, so train and val losses are always in `logs/<run>/csv_metrics/metrics.csv`
regardless of Comet.

## Measured runtimes: what to request

Every `#SBATCH --time` in the submit scripts is set from a measured run, at 1.3x the
measured wall time rounded up to the hour, and carries a comment naming that run. Do not
copy a `--time` line from another script. The measurements on this code, all 200 epochs:

| model | hardware | matcher | wall time | request | job |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| paper model, 12.1M (`base.yaml`) | 6x L4 (2 nodes), batch 170/GPU | scipy | 19 h 05 | 25 h | 37233919 (paper clone) |
| small, 0.82M (`base_small.yaml`) | 3x L4, batch 170/GPU x 2 accumulation | scipy | 20 h 02 | 27 h | 39236741 (paper clone) |
| small | 1x B200, batch 2048 | `device_solver: jv` | **8 h 59** at 311 ms/step | 12 h | 41758027 |
| small | 1x B200, batch 2048 | host `lap1015_late` | 1,591 ms/step over 300 steps, 84% in the host solve (projected 45 h) | do not use on a B200 | 41755775 |
| small | 3x L4, batch 170/GPU x 2 accumulation | `lap1015_late` | 15 h 07 | 20 h | 41750149 |

For orientation only, the head-based v7 model (0.70M) at the B200 geometry took 6 h 28 to
7 h 40 with the GPU matcher and 23 h 15 with the host matcher (`main`, README_HPG.md there).
Expect this code to stay about a quarter slower per step than those numbers at the same
geometry, and budget for it: 311 ms/step here against 251-255 ms/step for the head model.
**Why is open.** The obvious candidate -- that the paper's model is 819K parameters against
v7's 702K because `Dense` defaults to gated SwiGLU here and to plain SiLU on head -- was
tested and does **not** explain it: two 300-step B200 pre-flights at one commit, 819,683
against 703,203 parameters, stepped within 6% of each other (jobs 41992197 / 41992198,
`studies/swiglu_silu/`). At this width the step is evidently not bound by the feed-forward
arithmetic. Separate from all of that, the paper's `Compile` callback compiled the whole
model as one graph and stepped a further 2.2x slower on a B200 until it was replaced by
head's encoder/decoder compile; a run that steps near 790 ms is hitting that, not this.

**No measurement for your case?** Run a preflight and project. Submit the training script
with a short step cap and a short limit, then read the projection off its log:

```shell
sbatch --time=00:30:00 submit_training_b200.sh <cfg> --trainer.max_steps=300
python project_runtime.py slurm_logs/slurm-<jobid>.<name>.out --epochs 200
```

It fits the step rate after torch.compile warm-up and prints the projected wall time and the
`--time` to request. It errs on the long side (epoch 0 runs slower than steady state), and it
only reports: the person submitting sets the limit on the full run.

## Outputs & monitoring

- **Run folder:** `logs/<name>_<YYYYMMDD>-T<HHMMSS>/` with `ckpts/`, the resolved
  `config.yaml`, `csv_metrics/`, and the Comet offline archive. `<name>` is the
  config's `name:` field unless overridden with `--name`.
- **SLURM stdout/stderr:** `slurm_logs/slurm-<jobid>.<jobname>.out`.

```shell
squeue -u $USER                                        # queued/running jobs
tail -f slurm_logs/slurm-<jobid>.*.out                 # live training log
sacct -j <jobid> --format=JobID,State,Elapsed,MaxRSS   # after it finishes
scancel <jobid>                                        # cancel
```

## Evaluation and validation

All on one L4. Each layers [`configs/eval.yaml`](./configs/eval.yaml) over the run's
config, which applies the evaluation rules from [`README.md`](./README.md): fp32,
`torch` attention, inference-mode data, and no `Compile` callback.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `submit_eval_l4.sh` | Parameterised eval: `RUN_DIR` and `CKPT_NAME` from the environment. Writes `<ckpt>__test.root` next to the checkpoint. |
| `submit_validate_run.sh` | Validation-only pass: re-score a checkpoint on the val set under the current code, into a fresh `logs/_val_<jobid>/`. Optional `CONFIG` scores it under another run's objective. |

```shell
sbatch --job-name=clic-eval-paper \
       --export=ALL,RUN_DIR=logs/<run_folder>,CKPT_NAME=<epoch=...ckpt> \
       submit_eval_l4.sh
```

Produce the performance plots with
[`notebooks/performance.ipynb`](./notebooks/performance.ipynb). To compare with the
paper's figures use the `mpflow_proxy` output, which is what the paper plots.
