"""Batched linear assignment solved on whichever device the costs already live on.

The CLIC training step hands the matcher ~10k independent assignment problems at once
(batch x the 4 decoder layers plus the final head), each at most a few hundred rows square.
The host solvers in :mod:`hepattn.models.matcher` need that whole stack copied device->host
first, and CPU-side parallelism over it saturates at ~16 threads. This module solves the same
problems in place on the GPU so the copy and the host stall disappear.

The algorithm is Bertsekas' auction with epsilon-scaling, in the Jacobi (all-unassigned-bid-at-
once) form, which is what makes it data-parallel. Rows bid for columns; a column goes to its
highest bidder and its price rises to the winning bid, which forces the evicted row to look
elsewhere. Bidding by the gap between a row's best and second-best column, plus ``eps``,
guarantees termination and leaves the assignment within ``n_rows * eps`` of optimal.

Costs are affine-normalised per problem before solving. This is exact -- every permutation
sums exactly ``n_rows`` entries, so ``(c - min) / range`` is a monotone map on total cost --
and it is what keeps the auction numerically sane: prices accumulate in units of the cost
range, so the raw sentinel that :class:`~hepattn.models.matcher.Matcher` uses for forbidden
assignments (``float32_max / 10``) would otherwise destroy the fp32 dynamic range.

Termination at ``eps > 0`` means the result is epsilon-optimal rather than provably optimal,
so :func:`batched_auction` reports which problems it actually solved and the caller is
expected to send the rest to an exact host solver.

Note on epsilon-scaling, which is not used by default and is the one real trap here. Auction
is usually run as a sequence of phases with a shrinking ``eps``, carrying the prices forward
and restarting the assignment. **That is wrong for the rectangular problems the matcher
actually poses.** The dual of the rectangular assignment problem requires ``p_j > 0`` only for
columns that are assigned; a forward auction maintains this within one phase, because a column
is priced only by being won and is never released. Carrying prices across a restart breaks it:
a column can enter a phase priced from the last one and end this one unassigned. Measured on
uniform random costs, scaling-with-carry is exact at ``num_rows == num_cols`` and badly wrong
below it -- gaps of ~1 on costs normalised to [0, 1], not the ``num_rows * eps`` the theory
promises. Resetting the prices each phase restores exactness but costs more rounds than a
single phase does, and a single phase is *also* the fastest option whenever the problem is
rectangular, which is the matcher's case (~50 valid targets into 150 query slots). Hence the
default of one phase, and the price reset for anyone who sets a schedule anyway.

    Args:

            see the module docstring for why scaling rarely pays here.

            ``num_valid_rows * eps_final`` of optimal in normalised cost units.
        eps_decay: Factor by which ``eps`` shrinks between scaling phases.
