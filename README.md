# hepattn

We present a general end-to-end ML approach for particle physics reconstruction by adapting cutting-edge object detection techniques.
We demonstrate that a single encoder-decoder transformer can solve many different reconstruction problems that traditionally required specialised, task-specific approaches for each domain.

This general approach has been applied to various reconstruction tasks and detector setups:

- **Pixel cluster splitting** - ATLAS [[Internal][tide]]
- **Hit filtering** - TrackML [[arXiv][trackml]], ITk [WIP]
- **Tracking** - TrackML [[arXiv][trackml]], ATLAS [[Internal][tide]]
- **Primary vertexing** - *Interested in working on this? Get in touch!*
- **Secondary vertexing** - Delphes [[EPJC][vertexing]]
- **Particle flow** - [WIP]

## 🛠️ Setup

First clone the repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:samvanstroud/hepattn.git
cd hepattn
```

We recommend using a container to set up and run the code.
This is necessary if your system's `libc` version is `<2.28` 
due to requirements of recent `torch` versions.
We use `pixi`'s CUDA image, which you can access with:

```shell
apptainer pull pixi.sif docker://ghcr.io/prefix-dev/pixi:0.45.0-noble-cuda-12.6.3
apptainer shell --nv pixi.sif
```

**📝 Note**: If you are not using the `pixi` container, you will need to make sure 
`pixi` is installed according to https://pixi.sh/latest/. 

You can then install the project with locked dependencies:

```shell
pixi install --locked
```

### The `lap1015` Extension

The `lap1015` linear assignment solver is a C++ extension vendored in
[`src/lap1015`](src/lap1015) and compiled from that source by `pixi install`. It
must be built from *this* repository's source, and not from an older or upstream
build, because only this version releases the GIL while solving. Without that, the
threaded matcher serialises: `Matcher(parallel_solver=True, n_jobs=16)` quietly runs
sixteen threads that all queue behind each other, and the `lap1015_late` solver ends
up roughly 2x slower than `scipy`.

**Check your build in one line:**

```shell
pixi run python -c "import lap1015; print(lap1015.releases_gil)"
```

`True` is what you want, and `pixi reinstall hepattn` is how you get it.

`False` needs care: the flag is set at **compile** time, so it is `False` on any
extension that was patched in place rather than rebuilt — even one that does
release the GIL. It reports how the binary was produced, not how it behaves. A
`False` here means "this build is not reproducible from `src/lap1015`", which is
reason enough to reinstall, but it is not on its own evidence that matching is
serialised.

To find out whether the solve is *actually* threaded, time it. On a B200 node at
the CLIC geometry a serialised solve costs ~5.6 s per step against ~0.8 s with
`n_jobs=16`; anything near the latter is threaded, whatever the flag says. That
distinction cost a day of investigation once — the warning is about provenance,
the timing is about behaviour.

**To rebuild:**

```shell
pixi reinstall hepattn
```

This recompiles the extension from `src/lap1015/src/main.cpp`. A plain `pixi install`
will *not* do it if the environment already exists — pixi sees the package version
unchanged and skips it, which is how a build can sit stale for weeks across edits to
the C++ source.

Two things guard this, and are worth knowing about if you change the build:

- `strict-config = false` in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) lets the build
  tolerate the `pixi-conda-environment` config-setting that pixi passes to the
  backend. Without it, scikit-build-core rejects the unknown option and
  `pixi install` fails outright on a fresh clone with
  `Unrecognized options in config-settings`.
- `tests/matching/test_solvers.py::test_lap1015_releases_gil` fails if the
  installed extension holds the GIL, so a stale build is caught by the test suite
  rather than by a warning nobody reads.

Note that scikit-build-core's `editable.rebuild = true` is *not* used, though it
looks like the obvious fix. Its import-time rebuild runs under the system `cmake`,
which cannot find the Python development headers, so it turns a stale extension
into an unimportable one. Rebuild explicitly instead.

### Optional: solving the matching on the GPU

By default the Hungarian matching runs on the host: the cost matrices are copied
device-to-host and solved across a thread pool. On a GPU that the model does not
saturate, the training step is host-bound and that copy plus solve dominates it.
For that case the `Matcher` has an opt-in device solver, an exact batched
Jonker-Volgenant (`torch-linear-assignment`) that solves in place on the GPU:

```yaml
matcher:
  class_path: hepattn.models.matcher.Matcher
  init_args:
    device_solver: jv
```

It is off by default and only worth turning on when training is host-bound. On a
GPU that is already busy the solver's own kernels cost more than the stall they
remove, so measure before adopting it. Its results are exact, as the host solvers'
are; the two are held to equal total assignment cost in
`tests/matching/test_device_solver.py`.

The backend is a CUDA extension that must be compiled against the environment's
torch, for the GPU it will run on, so it is not a pixi dependency. Build it with

```shell
pixi run bash setup/build_torch_linear_assignment.sh
```

and follow the instructions it prints (put the build on `PYTHONPATH`, with
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` pointing at the environment's `lib`). The script sets the two
things that go wrong otherwise: `FORCE_CUDA=1`, without which a build on a
GPU-less login node silently produces a CPU-only extension, and
`TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST`, since there is no GPU there to detect. `Matcher` checks
for both failure modes at construction and refuses a missing or CPU-only build.
The script also patches the kernel's launch geometry for Blackwell GPUs: upstream
has no block-size entry for compute capability 10, so a B200 fell back to 128
threads per block and left almost half of its SMs idle during the solve. 32 was
measured fastest there, with identical assignments.

Three callbacks in `hepattn.callbacks` instrument the matcher for exactly these
decisions: `MatcherTimer` attributes the training step's wall clock to the
matcher's buckets, `MatcherCostDump` saves one step's real cost matrices for
offline replay, and `MatcherShadow` solves every problem on both device and host
and records how often the two assignments differ.

## 🌟 Activating the Environment

To run the installed environment, use:

```shell
pixi shell
```

You can close the environment with `exit`.
See the [`pixi shell` docs](https://pixi.sh/latest/reference/cli/pixi/shell/) for more information.

## 🧪 Running Tests

Once inside the environment, if a GPU and relevant external data are available, just run: 

```shell
pytest
```

To test parts of the code that don't require a GPU, run:

```shell
pytest -m 'not gpu'
```

To test parts of the code that don't require external input data, run:

```shell
pytest -m 'not requiresdata'
```

Please note that the current CI only tests the parts of the code that don't require a GPU or external input data:

```shell
pytest -m 'not gpu and not requiresdata'
```
